# MusicGeneration_LSTM
## Music Generation using Character RNN and LSTMs
The code should be structured with a README that clearly specifies the following:

1. List the original source for your code base. Include the URL to the original source.
The code is implemnented from scratch and ideas are taken from :

a. https://medium.com/datadriveninvestor/music-generation-using-deep-learning-85010fb982e2
\n b. https://github.com/gauravtheP/Music-Generation-Using-Deep-Learning

2. The list of files that you modified and the specific functions within each file you modified for your project.
3. A list of commands to train baseline 
To train the model:
python train_model.py
This needs you to have the initial data files as present in the initial project files. 
4. Software Requirements:
a. TensorFlow 1.12
b. Keras 
b. numpy
c. json
