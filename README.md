## Music Generation using Character RNN and LSTMs
The code should be structured with a README that clearly specifies the following:

1. List the original source for your code base. Include the URL to the original source.
2. The list of files that you modified and the spe- cific functions within each file you modified for your project.
3. A list of commands that provide how you train and test your baseline and the systems you built.
4. A list of the major software requirements that are needed to run your system. (E.g. Tensor- flow 2.3, Python 243.12, CUDA abd2.0, nltk- 2401.11, allen-nlp 5.0).
