# MusicGeneration_LSTM
## Music Generation using Character RNN and LSTMs
The code should be structured with a README that clearly specifies the following:

1. The code is implemnented using ideas from existing work of Gaurav Sharma. Here is the link to his blog and his GitHub Repository :
a. https://medium.com/datadriveninvestor/music-generation-using-deep-learning-85010fb982e2
b. https://github.com/gauravtheP/Music-Generation-Using-Deep-Learning

2. The list of files that you modified and the specific functions within each file you modified for your project:
    Both our files are generated differently 
3. A list of commands to train baseline 
Type the following command in your working directory to start training the baseline model:  
*python train_model.py*
Type the following command to generate new sheet music:  
*python generator.py* . 
This needs you to have the initial data files as present in the initial project files.  
4. Software Requirements:  
a. TensorFlow 1.12   
b. Keras   
c. numpy  
d. json
